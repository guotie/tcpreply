1.1 What is this FAQ for?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpreplay is a suite of powerful tools, but with that power comes
complexity. While I have done my best to write good man pages for
tcpreplay and it's associated utilities, I understand that many people
may want more information then I can provide in the man pages. Additionally,
this FAQ attempts to cover material which I feel will be of use to
people using tcpreplay, as well as common questions that occur on
the Tcpreplay-Users &lt;tcpreplay-users@lists.sourceforge.net&gt; mailing
list.

The source code is available in tarball format on the tcpreplay homepage:

</H2>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>You'll need the libnet and libpcap libraries.
</LI>
<LI>To support the jump to offset feature, you'll need the libpcapnav<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot38"><SUP>2</SUP></A> library.
</LI>
<LI>To support the packet decoding feature you'll need tcpdump<A NAME="tex2html3"

</LI>
<LI>You'll also need a compatible operating system. Basically, any UNIX-like
or UNIX-based operating system should work. Linux, *BSD, Solaris,

with any UNIX-like/based OS, please let me know.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02015000000000000000">
1.5 How do I compile tcpreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Two easy steps:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>As a normal user: <I>./configure &amp;&amp; make</I> 
</LI>
<LI>As root: <I>make test -i &amp;&amp; make install</I>
</LI>
</OL>
There are some optional arguments which can be passed to the configure
script which may help in cases where your libnet, libpcap, libpcapnav
or tcpdump installation is not standard or if it can't determine the
correct network interface card to use for testing. If you find that
configure isn't completing correctly, run: <I>./configure -help</I>
for more information.

<P>
A few comments about 'make test':

<P>

<UL>
<LI>make test is just a series of sanity checks which try to find serious
bugs (crashes) in tcpprep and tcpreplay.
</LI>
<LI>make test requires at least one properly configured network interface.
If the configure script can't guess what a valid interface is you
can specify it with the -with-testnic and -with-testnic2 arguments.
</LI>
<LI>If make test fails, often you can find details in test/test.log.
</LI>
<LI>OpenBSD's make has a bug where it ignores the MAKEFLAGS variable in
the Makefile, hence you'll probably want to run: <I>make -is test</I>
instead.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02016000000000000000">
1.6 Are there binaries available?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Occasionally. And even when we do, generally only for one or two operating
systems. Generally speaking, we assume people who want to use a tool
like this can figure out how to compile it.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02017000000000000000">
1.7 Is there a Microsoft Windows port?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Not really. We had one user port the code over for a slightly old
version of tcpreplay to Windows. Now we're looking for someone to
help merge and maintain the code in to the main development tree.
If you're interested in helping with this please contact Aaron Turner
or the tcpreplay-users list.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02018000000000000000">
1.8 How is tcpreplay licensed?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpreplay is licensed under a BSD-style license. For details, see
Appendix A.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02019000000000000000">
1.9 What is tcpreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
In the simplest terms, tcpreplay is a tool to send network traffic
stored in pcap format back onto the network; basically the exact opposite
of tcpdump. Tcpreplay also has the ability to edit various packet
headers as the packets are sent. Tcpreplay is also a suite of tools:
tcpreplay, tcpprep, pcapmerge, capinfo and flowreplay.

1.10 What isn't tcpreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpreplay is <I>not</I> a tool to replay captured traffic to a server
or client. Specifically, tcpreplay does not have the ability to rewrite
IP addresses to a user-specified value or synchronize TCP sequence
and acknowledgment numbers. In other words, tcpreplay can't ``connect''
to a server or be used to emulate a server and have clients connect
to it. If you're looking for that, check out flowreplay.

1.11 What are some uses for tcpreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Originally, tcpreplay was written to test network intrusion detection
systems (NIDS), however tcpreplay has been used to test firewalls,
routers, and other network devices.

1.12 What are some uses for flowreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
A lot of people wanted a tool like tcpreplay, but wanted to be able
to replay traffic <I>to</I> a server. Since tcpreplay was unable to
do this, I developed flowreplay which replays the data portion of
the flow, but recreates the connection to the specified server(s).
This makes flowreplay an ideal tool to test host intrusion detection
systems (HIDS) as well as captured exploits and security patches when
the actual exploit code is not available. Please note that flowreplay
is still alpha quality code and is currently missing some important
features.

1.13 What happened to version 1.5?</A>
</H2>

After looking at all the changes that have happened over the last
year or so, I decided that it was finally time to graduate tcpreplay

1.14 What is the history of tcpreplay?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpreplay has had quite a few authors over the past five or so years.
One of the advantages of the BSD and GPL licenses is that if someone
becomes unable or unwilling to continue development, anyone else can
take over.

<P>
Originally, Matt Undy of Anzen Computing wrote tcpreplay. Matt released
version 1.0.1 sometime in 1999. Sometime after that, Anzen Computing
was (at least partially) purchased by NFR and development ceased.

<P>
Then in 2001, two people independently started work on tcpreplay:
Matt Bing of NFR and Aaron Turner. After developing a series of patches
(the -adt branch), Aaron attempted to send the patches in to be included
in the main development tree.

<P>
After some discussion between Aaron and Matt Bing, they decided to
continue development together. Since then, over a dozen stable releases
have been made and more then twenty new features have been added,
including the addition of a number of accessory tools.

<P>
Today, Aaron continues active development of the code.

with the pound sign (#) are considered comments and ignored. An example
config file follows:

Tcpreplay can also split traffic so that each side of a connection
is sent out a different interface<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="#foot103"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. In order to do this, tcpreplay needs the name of the second interface
(-j) and a way to split the traffic. Currently, there are two ways
to split traffic:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>-C = split traffic by source IP address which is specified in CIDR

When splitting traffic, it is important to remember that traffic that
matches the filter is sent out the primary interface (-i). In this
case, when splitting traffic by source IP address, you provide a list
of networks in CIDR notation. For example:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>To send traffic from 10.0.0.0/8 out eth0 and everything else out eth1:

4.5 Replaying packets which are bigger then the MTU</A>
</H2>

<P>
Occasionally, you might find yourself trying to replay a pcap file
which contains packets which are larger then the MTU for the sending
interface. This might be due to the packets being captured on the
loopback interface or on a 1000Mbps ethernet interface supporting
``jumbo frames''. I've even seen packets which are 1500 bytes
but contain both an ethernet header and trailer which bumps the total
frame size to 1518 which is 4 bytes too large.

<P>
By default, tcpreplay will skip these packets and not send them. Alternatively,
you can specify the -T flag to truncate these packets to the MTU and
then send them. Of course this may invalidate your testing, but it
has proven useful in certain situations. Also, when this feature is
enabled, tcpreplay will automatically recalculate the IP and TCP,
UDP or ICMP checksums as needed. Example:

4.6 Writing packets to a file</A>
</H2>

<P>
It's not always necessary to write packets to the network. Since tcpreplay
has so many features which modify and select which packets are sent,
it is occasionally useful to save these changes to another pcap file
for comparison. Rather then running a separate tcpdump process to
capture the packets, tcpreplay now supports output directly to a file.
Example:

<P>
<I>tcpreplay -i eth0 -w output.pcap -F -u pad -x E:10.0.0.0/8 input1.pcap
input2.pcap input3.pcap</I>

<P>
Notice that specifying an interface is still required (required for

<P>
N<SMALL>OTE:</SMALL> It is critical for your sanity (and to prevent your

the local system and broadcasts, you can specify the ``not_nosy''

5.4 Rewriting Layer 2 with -2</A>
</H2>

<P>
Starting in the 2.0.x branch, tcpreplay can replace the existing layer
2 header with one of your choosing. This is useful for when you want
to change the layer 2 header type or add a header for pcap files without
one. Each pcap file tells the type of frame. Currently tcpreplay knows
how to deal with the following pcap(3) frame types:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>DLT_EN10MB
<BR>
Replace existing 802.3/Ethernet II header
</LI>
<LI>DLT_RAW
<BR>
Frame has no Layer 2 header, so we can add one.
</LI>
<LI>DLT_LINUX_SLL
<BR>
Frame uses the Linux Cooked Socket header which is most commonly created
with <I>tcpdump -i any</I> on a Linux system.
</LI>
</UL>
Tcpreplay accepts the new Layer 2 header as a string of comma separated
hex values such as: 0xff,0xac,0x00,0x01,0xc0,0x64. Note that the leading
'0x' is <I>not</I> required.

<P>
Potential uses for this are to add a layer 2 header for DLT_RAW captures
or add/remove ethernet tags or QoS features.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04025000000000000000">
5.5 Rewriting DLT_LINUX_SLL (Linux Cooked Socket) captures</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpdump uses a special frame type to store captures created with the
``-i any'' argument. This frame type uses a custom 16 byte layer
2 header which tracks which interface captured the packet and often
the source MAC address of the original ethernet frame. Unfortunately,
it never stores the destination MAC address and it doesn't store a
source MAC when the packet is captured on the loopback interface.
Normally, tcpreplay can't replay these pcap files because there isn't
enough information in the LINUX_SLL header to do so; however two
options do exist:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>You can send these packets with -2 which will replace the LINUX_SLL
header with an ethernet header of your choosing.
</LI>
<LI>You can specify a destination MAC via -I and -J in which case tcpreplay
will use the stored source MAC and create a new 802.3 Ethernet header.
Note that if the pcap contains loopback packets, you will also need
to specify -k and/or -K to specify the source MAC as well or they
will be skipped.

5.6 Rewriting IP Addresses (pseudo-NAT)</A>
</H2>

<P>
Pseudo-NAT allows the mapping of IP addresses in IPv4 and ARP packets
from one subnet to another subnet of the same or different size. This
allows some or all the traffic sent to appear to come from a different
IP subnet then it actually was captured on.

<P>
The mapping is done through a user specified translation table comprised
of one or more source and destination network(s) in the format of
&lt;srcnet&gt;/&lt;masklen&gt;:&lt;dstnet&gt;/&lt;masklen&gt; deliminated by a comma. Mapping
is done by matching IP addresses to the source subnet and rewriting
the most significant bits with the destination subnet. For example:

<P>
<I>tcpreplay -i eth0 -N 10.100.0.0/16:172.16.10.0/24 sample.pcap</I>

<P>
would match any IP in the 10.100.0.0/16 subnet and rewrite it as if
it came from or sent to the 172.16.10.0/24 subnet. Ie: 10.100.5.88
would become 172.16.10.88 and 10.100.99.45 would become 172.16.10.45.
But 10.150.7.44 would not be rewritten.

<P>
For any given IP address, the translation table is applied in order
(so if there are multiple mappings, earlier maps take precedence)
and occurs only once per IP (no risk of an address getting rewritten
a second time).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04027000000000000000">
5.7 Advanced pseudo-NAT</A>
</H2>

<P>
Pseudo-NAT also works with traffic splitting (using two interfaces
or output files) but with a few important differences. First you have
the option of specifying one or two pseudo-NAT tables. Using a single
pseudo-NAT table means that the source and destination IP addresses
of both interfaces are rewritten using the same rules. Using two pseudo-NAT
tables (specifying -N &lt;Table1&gt; -N &lt;Table2&gt;) will cause the source
and destination IP addresses to be rewritten differently for each
interface using the following matrix:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">Out Primary Interface</TD>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER">Out Secondary Interface
<BR>
Src IP</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
While seemingly a bit confusing, this feature provides a number of
interesting possibilities such as the ability to rewrite the IP headers
of packets in the case where traffic is captured on the loopback interface
(and the source and destination address is always 127.0.0.1) so that
tcpreplay can make it look like two different systems are talking
to each other (you'll probably also need to specify the source and
destination MAC addresses via -I, -J, -k and -K).

<P>

5.8 IP Endpoints</A>

<P>
While pseudo-NAT provides a great deal of flexibility, it is often
more complicated then is necessary for testing of inline devices.
As a simplier alternative, tcpreplay supports the concept of rewriting
all traffic to so that it appears to be between two IP addresses:

<P>
<I>tcpreplay -i eth0 -j eth1 -c sample.cache -e 10.0.0.1:10.1.1.1

<P>
Will rewrite all the traffic so that it is between 10.0.0.1 and 10.1.1.1.
The equivalent command using -N would be:

<P>
<I>tcpreplay -i eth0 -j eth1 -c sample.cache -N 0.0.0.0/0:10.0.0.1
-N 0.0.0.0/0:10.1.1.1 sample.pcap</I>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04029000000000000000">
5.9 Unifying Dual-Outputs</A>
</H2>

<P>
Since a number of tcpreplay's packet editing functions require splitting
traffic between client and servers, one problem that may arrise is
needing to edit packets but still output to a single interface or
file. The solution to this is to use the one output option -O which
causes packets to be processed as if they will be split between the
interfaces/files, but then always go out the primary interface or
file. Note that even though only one interface/file will be written
to, both -i and -j must be specified; although they can be the same
physical interface.

Cache files have nothing linking them to a given libpcap file, so

6.6 Why would I want to use tcpreplay with two network cards? </A>

<P>
Tcpreplay traditionally is good for putting traffic on a given network,
often used to test a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). However,
there are cases where putting traffic onto a subnet in this manner
is not good enough- you have to be able to send traffic *through*
a device such as a router, firewall, or bridge.

In these cases, being able to use a single source file (libpcap) for
both ends of the connection solves this problem.

6.8 What are these 'modes' tcpprep has? </A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpprep has three basic modes which require the user to specify how
to split traffic.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>CIDR (-c) mode requires the user to provide a list of networks. Any
packet with a source IP in one of these networks gets sent out the
primary interface.
</LI>
<LI>Regex (-r) mode requires the user to provide a regular expression.
Any packet with a source IP matching the regex gets sent out the primary
interface.
</LI>
<LI>Port (-p) mode splits TCP/UDP traffic based on the destination port
in the header. Normally, ports 0-1023 are considered ``server''
ports and everything else a client port. You can create your own custom
mapping file in the same format as /etc/services (see the services(5)
man page for details) by specifying -s &lt;file&gt;.
</LI>
</UL>
And four auto modes in which tcpprep decides how to split traffic.
Auto modes are useful for when you don't know much about the contents
of the dump file in question and you want to split traffic up based
upon servers and clients.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Auto/Router (-a -n router) mode trys to find the largest network(s)
that contain all the servers and no clients. Any unknown system is
automatically re-classified as servers if it's inside the server network(s),
otherwise it is classified as a client.
</LI>
<LI>Auto/Bridge (-a -n bridge) mode makes the assumption that the clients
and servers are horribly intermixed on the network and there's no
way to subnet them. While this takes less processing time to create
the cache file it is unable to deal with unknown systems.
</LI>
<LI>Auto/Client (-a -n client) mode which works just like Auto/Bridge
mode, except that any system it can't figure out is treated like a
client.

Tcpprep does an initial pass over the libpcap file to build a binary
tree (one node per IP). For each IP, it keeps track of how many times
it was a client or server. It then does a second pass of the file
using the data in the tree and the ratio to determine if an IP is
a client or server. If tcpprep is unable to determine the type (client
or server) for each and every packet, then auto/bridge mode will fail.
In these cases, it is best to use a different auto mode.

9.9 Why is tcpreplay not sending all the packets?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Every now and then, someone emails the tcpreplay-users list, asking
if there is a bug in tcpreplay which causes it not to send all the
packets. This usually happens when the user uses the -R flag or is
replaying a high-speed pcap file (&gt; 50Mbps, although this number is
dependant on the hardware in use).

<P>
The short version of the answer is: no, we are not aware of any bugs
which might cause a few packets to not be sent.

<P>
The longer version goes something like this:

<P>
If you are running tcpreplay multiple times and are using tcpdump
or other packet sniffer to count the number packets sent and are getting
different numbers, it's not tcpreplay's fault. The problem lies in
one of two places:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>It is well known that tcpdump and other sniffers have a problem keeping
up with high-speed traffic. Furthermore, the OS in many cases <I>lies</I>
about how many packets were dropped. Tcpdump will repeat this lie
to you. In other words, tcpdump isn't seeing all the packets. Usually
this is a problem with the network card or driver which may or may
not be fixable. Try another network card/driver.
</LI>
<LI>When tcpreplay sends a packet, it actually gets copied to a send buffer
in the kernel. If this buffer is full, the kernel is supposed to tell
tcpreplay that it didn't copy the packet to this buffer. If the kernel
has a bug which squelches this error, tcpreplay will not keep trying
to send the packet and will move on to the next one. Currently I am
not aware of any OS kernels with this bug, but it is possible that
it exists. If you find out that your OS has this problem, please let
me know so I can list it here.
</LI>
</OL>
If for some reason, you still think its a bug in tcpreplay, by all
means read the code and tell me how stupid I am. The do_packets()
function in do_packets.c is where tcpreplay processes the pcap file
and sends all of the packets.

10.1 Libpcap</A>
</H2>

<P>
As of tcpreplay v1.4, you'll need to have libpcap installed on your
system. As of v2.0, you'll need at least version 0.6.0 or better,
but I only test our code with the latest version. Libpcap can be obtained
on the tcpdump homepage<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="#foot317"><SUP>11</SUP></A>.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04072000000000000000">
10.2 Libnet</A>
</H2>

<P>
Tcpreplay v1.3 is the last version to support the old libnet API (everything
before 1.1.x). As of v1.4 you will need to use Libnet 1.1.0 or better
which can be obtained from the Libnet homepage<A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="#foot318"><SUP>12</SUP></A>. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04073000000000000000">
10.3 Libpcapnav</A>
</H2>

<P>
Starting with v2.0, tcpreplay can use libpcapnav to support the jump
offset feature. If libpcapnav is not found on the system, that feature
will be disabled. Libpcapnav can be found on the NetDude homepage<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="#foot319"><SUP>13</SUP></A>. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION04074000000000000000">
10.4 Tcpdump</A>
</H2>

<P>
As of 2.0, tcpreplay uses tcpdump (the binary, not code) to decode
packets to STDOUT in a human readable (with practice) format as it
sends them. If you would like this feature, tcpdump must be installed
on your system.

<P>
N<SMALL>OTE:</SMALL> The location of the tcpdump binary is hardcoded in
tcpreplay at compile time. If tcpdump gets renamed or moved, the feature
will become disabled.

captured</A><A
 HREF="FAQ.html#tex2html4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Tcpreplay makes a &#34;best&#34; effort to replay traffic
at the given rate, but due to limitations in hardware or the pcap
file itself, it may not be possible. Capture files with only a few
packets in them are especially susceptible to this.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="foot93">... times</A><A
 HREF="FAQ.html#tex2html5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>Looping files resets internal counters which control the speed that
the file is replayed. Also because the file has to be closed and re-opened,
an added delay between the last and first packet may occur.

FAQ.
