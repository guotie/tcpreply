This is a general list of things which should/could/may be done.
If any of these features interest you let me know- especially if you're
willing and able to help code it.

- Look at VLAN packets
    - others non-vanilla types?
    - Add tags?  Remove tags?  Change tags?

- Add support for setting the ethernet protocol field so we can use
    -I, -K to fill out an entire ethernet header w/o using -2

- Add a secondary interface full layer two rewrite option

- Fix MAC rewriting to allow sending packets with a MAC of 00:00:00:00:00:00

- Add support for more linktypes (Prism Monitor, 802.11, etc)
    - Make it easier for others to add support for others

- Rip out packet munger from tcpreplay and put it into another tool so
  that tcpreplay can be more optimized
    - perhaps use libnetdude?
    - make into a library?
    - definately put it into a seperate binary

- Improve config file format
  - better variable names
  - use "var: value" format
  - have tcpreplay, tcpprep, tcprewrite sections

- Add support for dual-nic send on one intf, wait for packet, send next.
  would be really useful for testing the effectiveness of how well an IPS
  detects and blocks attacks.

- Support fragrouter like features 
    - basic IP fragmenation
    - TCP fudging 
    - then more advanced stuff

- Support connection tracking and generating 3way handshake for connections
  missing them.

- Bump Syn/Ack numbers by a random or given value so that running 
  the same pcap will behave as different streams.

- Improve flowreplay so it actually works

- IPv6 support?
