<FONT COLOR="#000000">Tcpreplay</FONT><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot362"><SUP>1</SUP></A> <FONT COLOR="#000000">was designed to replay traffic previously captured
in the pcap format back onto the wire for testing NIDS and other passive
devices. Over time, it was enhanced to be able to test in-line network
devices. However, a re-occurring feature request for tcpreplay is
to connect to a server in order to test applications and host TCP/IP
stacks. It was determined early on, that adding this feature to tcpreplay
was far too complex, so I decided to create a new tool specifically
designed for this.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Flowreplay is designed to replay traffic at Layer
4 or 7 depending on the protocol rather then at Layer 2 like tcpreplay
does. This allows flowreplay to connect to one or more servers using
a pcap savefile as the basis of the connections. Hence, flowreplay
allows the testing of applications running on real servers rather
then passive devices. </FONT>

3.2 <FONT COLOR="#000000">Handling Multiple Connections</FONT></A>
</H2>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Because a pcap file can contain multiple simultaneous
flows, we need to be able to support that too. The biggest problem
with this is reading packet data in a different order then stored
in the pcap file. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Reading and writing to multiple sockets is easy
with select() or poll(), however a pcap file has it's data stored
serially, but we need to access it randomly. There are a number of
possible solutions for this such as caching packets in RAM where they
can be accessed more randomly, creating an index of the packets in
the pcap file, or converting the pcap file to another format altogether.
Alternatively, I've started looking at libpcapnav</FONT><A NAME="tex2html5"

process packets out of order.</FONT>

understanding the actual protocol involved, probably the best general
solution is waiting for a given period of time after no more data

traffic doesn't elicit a response from the server (implement some
kind of timeout?). This will be the basis for the default plug-in.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000">Dealing with IP fragmentation and TCP stream reassembly

implementing a significant portion of a TCP/IP stack. One thought
is to use libnids</FONT><A NAME="tex2html6"

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">The biggest asynchronous problem, that pcap files
are serial, has to be solved in a scaleable manner. Not much can be
assumed about the network traffic contained in a pcap savefile other
then Murphy's Law will be in effect. This means we'll have to deal

<FONT COLOR="#000000">How we implement parallel processing of the pcap

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Most Unix systems limit the maximum number of open file descriptors
a single process can have. Generally speaking this shouldn't be a
problem except for highly parallel pcap's.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">There are five major complications with flowreplay:</FONT>
<P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The IP datagrams may be fragmented- we won't be
able to use the standard 5-tuple (src/dst IP, src/dst port, protocol)
to lookup which flow a packet belongs to.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">IP fragments may arrive out of order which will
complicate ordering of data to be sent.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The TCP segments may arrive out of order which will
complicate ordering of data to be sent.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Packets may be missing in the pcap file because
they were dropped during capture.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are tools like fragrouter which intentionally
create non-deterministic situations.</FONT>
</LI>
</OL>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">First off, I've decided, that I'm not going to worry
about fragrouter or it's cousins. I'll handle non-deterministic situations
one and only one way, so that the way flowreplay handles the traffic
will be deterministic. Perhaps, I'll make it easy for others to write
a plug-in which will change it, but that's not something I'm going
to concern myself with now.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Missing packets in the pcap file will probably make
that flow unplayable. There are proabably certain situation where
we can make an educated guess, but this is far too complex to worry
about for the first stable release.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">That still leaves creating a basic TCP/IP stack
in user space. The good news it that there is already a library which
does this called libnids. As of version 1.17, libnids can process
packets from a pcap savefile (it's not documented in the man page,
but the code is there).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">A potential problem with libnids though is that
it has to maintain it's own state/cache system. This not only means
additional overhead, but jumping around in the pcap file as I'm planning
on doing to handle multiple simultaneous flows is likely to really
confuse libnids' state engine. Also, libnids is licensed under the
GPL, but I want flowreplay released under a BSD-like license; I need
to research if the two are compatible in this way.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Possible solutions:</FONT>
<P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Developing a custom wedge between the capture file
and libnids which will cause each packet to only be processed a single
time.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Use libnids to process the pcap file into a new
flow-based format, effectively putting the TCP/IP stack into a dedicated
utility.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Develop a custom user-space TCP/IP stack, perhaps
based on a BSD TCP/IP stack, much like libnids is based on Linux 2.0.37.</FONT>
</LI>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">Screw it and say that IP fragmentation and out of
order IP packets/TCP segments are not supported. Not sure if this
will meet the needs of potential users.</FONT>

5 <FONT COLOR="#000000">pcap vs flow File Format</FONT></A>
</H1>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">As stated before, the pcap file format really isn't
well suited for flowreplay because it uses the raw packet as a container
for data. Flowreplay however isn't interested in packets, it's interested
in data streams</FONT><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="#foot404"><SUP>8</SUP></A> <FONT COLOR="#000000">which may span one or more TCP/UDP segments, each
comprised of an IP datagram which may be comprised of multiple IP
fragments. Handling all this additional complexity requires a full
TCP/IP stack in user space which would have additional feature requirements
specific to flowreplay.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Rather then trying to do that, I've decided to create
a pcap preprocessor for flowreplay called: flowprep. Flowprep will
handle all the TCP/IP defragmentation/reassembly and write out a file
containing the data streams for each flow.</FONT>

flowreplay. Flowreplay is designed to be a mere framework for connecting
captured flows in a flow file with socket file handles. How data is
processed and what should be done with it will be done via plug-ins.</FONT>

flowreplay should send data via one or more sockets. The plug-in can

of determining if it appropriate to send data or wait for data to
received. If necessary, a plug-in can also modify the data sent.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Each time poll() returns, flowreplay calls the plug-ins
for the flows which either have data waiting or in the case of a timeout,
those flows which timed out. Afterwords, all the flows are processed

POLL. And the process repeats until there are no more nodes in the
tree.</FONT>

6.2 <FONT COLOR="#000000">The Default Plug-in</FONT></A>
</H2>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Initially, flowreplay will ship with one basic plug-in
called ``default''. Any flow which doesn't have a specific plug-in
defined, will use default. The goal of the default plug-in is to work
``good enough'' for a majority of single-flow protocols such as
SMTP, HTTP, and Telnet. Protocols which use encryption (SSL, SSH,
etc) or multiple flows (FTP, RPC, etc) will never work with the default
plug-in. Furthermore, the default plug-in will only support connections</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>to</I></FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">a server, it will not
support accepting connections from clients.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">The default plug-in will provide no data level manipulation
and only a simple method for detecting when it is time to send data
to the server. Detecting when to send data will be done by a ``no
more data'' timeout value. Basically, by using the pcap file as a
means to determine the order of the exchange, anytime it is the servers
turn to send data, flowreplay will wait for the first byte of data
and then start the ``no more data'' timer. Every time more data
is received, the timer is reset. If the timer reaches zero, then flowreplay
sends the next portion of the client side of the connection. This
is repeated until the the flow has been completely replayed or a ``server
hung'' timeout is reached. The server hung timeout is used to detect
a server which crashed and never starts sending any data which would
start the ``no more data'' timer.</FONT>
<P>

timers will be user defined values and global to all flows using the
